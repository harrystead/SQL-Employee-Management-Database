### MySQL Employee Database

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. In this assignment, your challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

Build a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to:

* Add departments, roles, employees
* View departments, roles, employees
* Update employee roles

Bonus points if you're able to:

* Update employee managers
* View employees by manager
* Delete departments, roles, and employees.
